# System Architecture
Full Flow Documentation ‚Äì Customer & Order Flow (with Microservices & RabbitMQ)
________________________________________
1. Customer Registration
A new customer starts by registering on the platform. The frontend collects user details and sends them to the Customer Service.
Data Required:
‚Ä¢	Name
‚Ä¢	Email
‚Ä¢	Phone
‚Ä¢	Password
‚Ä¢	Address
Flow:
‚Ä¢	The Customer Service validates inputs.
‚Ä¢	Password is hashed before storing.
‚Ä¢	A customer document is created in the Customer Service database.
‚Ä¢	A JWT token is generated and returned to the frontend.
________________________________________
2. Customer Login
Existing users can log in using their email and password.
Flow:
‚Ä¢	User enters email and password.
‚Ä¢	Customer Service verifies the credentials.
‚Ä¢	On success, returns JWT token for accessing authenticated routes.
‚Ä¢	On failure, sends an error response.
________________________________________
3. Creating an Order
Once logged in, a user can create an order by selecting products. The Customer Service will not directly handle product details; instead, it will communicate with the Order Service via RabbitMQ.
Steps:
1.	Frontend sends the order request (with product IDs and quantities) to Customer Service.
2.	Customer Service:
o	Verifies the user's token.
o	Prepares the order message including:
ÔÇß	Customer ID
ÔÇß	Product list
ÔÇß	Quantity
ÔÇß	Other metadata (timestamp, order status)
o	Sends this message to a RabbitMQ queue (create_order) for the Order Service.
3.	Order Service:
o	Listens to create_order queue.
o	Validates product availability.
o	Calculates prices and totals.
o	Creates a new order record in its own database.
o	Publishes an create_order event to notify other services (if needed).
o	Sends a confirmation message back via RabbitMQ to Customer Service (if synchronous acknowledgment is needed).
4.	Customer Service:
o	Optionally updates user order history or returns the confirmation to frontend.
________________________________________
4. Fetching All Orders for a Customer (New User Orders)
To view all past orders of a customer:
Flow:
1.	Frontend requests order history from Customer Service.
2.	Customer Service:
o	Extracts customer ID from JWT.
o	Sends a request to Order Service via RabbitMQ (order_detail_queue queue), passing the customer ID.
3.	Order Service:
o	Queries its database for all orders belonging to the customer.
o	Sends back the list of orders to Customer Service through RabbitMQ.
4.	Customer Service:
o	Forwards the order list to the frontend.
________________________________________
5. Fetching a Single Order
When a user wants to view the details of a specific order:
Flow:
1.	Frontend sends a request with the Order ID to Customer Service.
2.	Customer Service:
o	Validates user identity via JWT.
o	Sends request to Order Service via RabbitMQ (single_order_queue queue).
3.	Order Service:
o	Fetches order by ID.
o	Sends back order data (including product breakdown, shipping status, etc.) through RabbitMQ.
4.	Customer Service:
o	Returns order data to frontend.
________________________________________
6. RabbitMQ Integration
RabbitMQ serves as the communication bridge between services.
Queues Used:
‚Ä¢	create_order ‚Üí Customer sends order creation request to Order Service.
‚Ä¢	order_detail_queue ‚Üí Customer Service requests order history.
‚Ä¢	single_order_queue ‚Üí Request for a specific order.
Benefits:
‚Ä¢	Loose coupling between services.
‚Ä¢	Each service has its own DB (Customer DB, Order DB).
‚Ä¢	Services can scale independently.
‚Ä¢	Failure tolerance: orders can be retried if queue is persistent.
________________________________________
7. Error Handling
‚Ä¢	If RabbitMQ is unavailable, a fallback mechanism (retry logic or queuing locally) can be implemented.
‚Ä¢	If the product is unavailable or order creation fails, Order Service responds with an error.
‚Ä¢	Customer Service should log and communicate failure gracefully to the frontend.
________________________________________

Microservices Overview
Service	Responsibility
Customer Service	Manages customer data, login, registration, forwards order requests
Order Service	Handles order logic: creation, lookup, pricing, status
Product Service*	(Optional) Used by Order Service to check stock/prices


# üßë‚Äçüíº Customer Microservice with RabbitMQ & JWT Auth
